# Karma Bot
**Reposts old shit from the past for useless internet points!!!**

This is the source code that was running the diogenesjunior2 reddit account. The account is now suspended, but here's a look at the bot:

## What did it do?

By peeking at the source code, you can tell what it did. For the lazy:

- Go to /r/random
- Grab random post from /top
- If images is hosted on i.redd.it or i.imgur.com:
  - download image
  - upload to imgur
  - submit to subreddit with link to repost

The "old" directory contains the original source code. It won't be updated at all. The "new" directory is something I maintain for fun, and will occasionally have some changes. For a bot that farms karma but doesn't repost, see my repo [here](https://github.com/Mr-Steal-Your-Script/Humanoid)

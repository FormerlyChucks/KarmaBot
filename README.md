**Reposts old shit from the past for useless internet points!!!**

This is the source code that was running the now suspended diogenesjunior2 reddit account.

## What did it do?

By peeking at the source code, you can tell what it did. For the lazy:

- Go to /r/random
- Grab random post from /top
- If images is hosted on i.redd.it or i.imgur.com:
  - download image
  - upload to imgur
  - submit to subreddit with link to repost
  
## Setup:

- The "old" directory contains the original source code and won't be updated at all.
- See the guide [here](https://mr-steal-your-script.github.io/KarmaBot.html?)
- The "new" directory is something I maintain for fun and will occasionally have some changes.
